# starling reel rotation
Starling extension to handle reels/wheels rotations. mostly used for slot machine games.

It does not support different icon width or height in the same column.

It does support:
  - transitions-based rotation
  - async answer from the server (keeps rotating if no answer was given)
  
  
ROADMAP:
	- [DONE] Fix the bad wheel stop with very delayed server answers
	- Clean the mess
	- [DONE] Add a stop button that skips the rotation to a certain point
  


You can try the sample in the SampleProject directory, it's a flashdevelop project.
You need to have flashdevelop configured for starling.
